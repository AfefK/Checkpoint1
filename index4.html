   <h2>Checkpoint n4 : </h2>
  <p id="myP">
    This is the checkpoint you asked us to realise !hope you like it ! :p
    next lines are just words to fill the p section (yup) :
    "Some people are intimidated by omelets, but trust us: if you can make scrambled eggs, you can make an omelet.
    You should always make an omelet in a nonstick pan. The best choice for a 2-egg omelet is an 8-inch omelet pan, 
    especially when you're first learning. But any nonstick saut√© pan will do as long as it's round with 
    sloped sides and between 6 inches and 10 inches in diameter.But don't try to make a 3-egg omelet in a 
    smaller pan. Once you've mastered the technique, you can move up to a 3-egg omelet, but
    you'll want to use a 10-inch omelet pan for that. (Here's a set that includes an 8-inch and a 10-inch pan.) 
    Also, you should al ways use a heat-resistant silicone spatula, so that it doesn't melt
    and so that you don't scratch your nonstick pan.""
